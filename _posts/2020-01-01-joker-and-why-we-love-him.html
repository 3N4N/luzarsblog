		<sup><i>Spoilers ahead for Batman(1989)</i></sup>

		</br></br>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>

		<p>
			It would be a hard task to find people who does not know about
			<i>Batman</i>, and an even harder task to find those among them who
			does not know about <i>Joker</i>. The idea of <i>Batman</i> and
			<i>Joker</i> goes hand in hand, just like Romeo and Juliet. Kidding
			aside, the masked duo are probably the best example of Nemesis
			System in pop culture history. So, strap on, and hearken to what a
			complete unfamiliar has to say about why the characters work so
			well together.

		<h2>Definitive Version</h2>

		<p>
			For me and everyone in my generation ‚Äî discounting those who grew
			up reading comics ‚Äî Christopher Nolan's <i>The Dark Knight</i> is
			the definitive version of Batman and Joker.  Now, I love Tim
			Burton's Batman starring Michael Keaton and Nicholson's unhinged
			performance as the Joker. But in that film, the characters of
			Batman and Joker are too harmonized, there is no sense of
			<i>chaos</i>. A sociopathic criminal named Jack Napier kills the
			parents of Bruce Wayne who becomes Batman. Some years later, Batman
			raids the lair of Jack Napier and during the commotion Jack falls
			into a vat of chemical and rises as the Joker.  I am of the opinion
			that Tim Burton probably took on the characters without giving the
			source material much heed and gave them his signature Gothic edge.
			Don't get me wrong, Burton's Batman is a wonderful film and I love
			it to death, but the Joker in that film is not
			Batman's nemesis.
		</p>

		</br>

		<h2>What even is a Nemesis</h2>

		<p>
			A <i>nemesis</i>, also called an <i>arch-enemy</i>, is first and
			foremost a villain. Generally a villain can clash with the hero in
			many ways: villain has an evil plan and our righteous hero can't
			conscientiously allow that, or, the hero has a good plan for the
			betterment of mankind and the villain can't allow that because it
			disrupts with his plan, etc. A nemesis, on the other hand, is a
			villain who has a personal vendetta against the hero. It doesn't
			matter if the hero's acts hamper the villain's plans in any way,
			the villain will disrupt the hero's acts in any way possible. In
			other words, the nemesis is a villain who is pitted against the
			hero because he personally hates him and wants to make his life as
			miserable as possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the way, the explanation above is in the context where the
			protagonist is the hero (good guy) and the antagonist is the
			villain (bad guy) to avoid complexity. I'm unsure how the Nemesis
			System would work in case of an anti-hero. Maybe I'll check on that
			some other time.
		</p>

		</br>

		<h2>Joker as the Nemesis of Batman</h2>

		<p>
			Now, let's see why Joker works so well against Batman and why he is
			the most memorable villain in the Batman Rogue Gallery even though
			he is ‚Äî most often ‚Äî not the most powerful enemy.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's look at the core character of the duo. Batman is a persona
			adorned by a millionaire, whose parents got killed in a simple
			mugging, to fight crime in Gotham. Joker is a persona worn by a
			psychiatric patient who thinks of himself as an agent of chaos.
			Already the two personae are ready to be put in conflict. But there
			is more.
		</p>

		<p>
			Batman uses a dark suit to install fear into his enemies. Some
			iterations show him to be afraid of bats as a child and that's why
			he decides to take a bat as his persona so he can use what he
			himself fears to fight what he stands against. Joker, on the other
			hand, uses a colorful and merry costume of a clown. But the purpose
			of that costume also is to inspire fear into his enemies. Look at
			the distinction: one uses a fearful dark suit to fight darkness and
			the other uses a colorful suit to incite chaos. These two personae
			are now fully realized to be pitted against each other until one
			succeeds in destroying the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any good story needs two kinds of conflicts: primary conflicts and
			secondary conflicts. Conflicts are any obstacle preventing a
			character from getting what they want.  A primary conflict is the
			main conflict of the story, that is, the conflict the story is
			based on. For example: Frodo wants to throw the One Ring in the
			Mount Doom but the servants of Sauron tries to stop him from doing
			so.  The secondary conflict is the emotional or psychological
			hurdle a protagonist must overcome to get what he wants. For
			example: Frodo keeps getting corrupted by the One Ring while he
			bears it.
		</p>

		<p>
			In case of Batman and Joker, the secondary conflict is the reason
			why Joker works so well against Batman even though he doesn't have
			as much physical strength or resources as Batman does.  Joker
			doesn't need strength or resources. He doesn't try to defeat Batman
			in hand-to-hand combat. Instead, he attacks what Batman is and what
			Batman fights for. You see, the whole ideology of Batman works on
			the notion that the weak needs protection from the evil and he
			needs to be that protection. But Joker tries to show him that the
			people don't want him, or rather they aren't worthy of his
			protection. There is a famous line in Alan Moore's <i>The Killing
			Joke</i> where Joker says, <q>All it takes is one bad day to reduce
			the sanest man alive to lunacy.</q> His whole purpose of being is
			to get Batman to the breaking point, to make Batman in the shape of
			himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			That's why Joker works so well against Batman. He doesn't
			repeatedly incur biblical catastrophes for Batman to stop
			(<i>Thanos</i> from <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>), he doesn't want to
			rule the world, he just wants to keep pushing Batman beyond his
			breaking point, hoping him to see that the people aren't agents of
			Good and they don't deserve him.  And Joker won't stop until Batman
			cracks. That's why Joker works so well against Batman. He adds
			continuously to the secondary conflict of any story he is in and,
			assuming our hero wins, strengthens the conviction of the hero,
			helping him, and us, realize that people are ultimately Good and
			only needs a helping hand to guide them.
		</p>

		</br>

		<h2>Afterthoughts</h2>

		<p>
			Joker has been portrayed by some of the best actors in every
			iterations from Jack Nicholson to Mark Hamill. Most of the
			portrayals were phenomenal. But Heath Ledger, God rest his soul,
			will always be remembered as the definitive Joker for our
			generation.
		</p>

		<p>
			A new trilogy of Batman movies are coming down the road directed by
			Matt Reeves with Robert Pattinson as the titular character. People
			might remember him from the <i>Twilight</i> series but he has
			proven his acting chops through many indie films. I am really
			excited to see what direction they take the Knight of Gotham
			towards.  Here's to Reeves, Robert Pattinson and the upcoming
			<i>Batman Trilogy</i> üçª
