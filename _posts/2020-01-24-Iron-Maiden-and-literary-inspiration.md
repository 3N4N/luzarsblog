As far back as I can remember, I've always had an affinity towards metal songs.
I don't have any sense of music or rhythm or stuff like that, but metal songs
have always been a way to shut off everything around me, including my brain. It
works sort of as a sensory deprivation device, if you will.

I learnt recently that High Fantasy and Science Fiction --- SFF, in short ---
have a deep connection with Metal music. In olden times, if you read Heinlein or
Tolkien or Donaldson or Lovecraft, you also listened to Metallica or ACDC or
Slayer, you arranged secret D&D campaigns; it all went together. That's why
Metal bands are best known to incorporate popular literary references in their
songs. There are countless examples of such phenomena. Being an avid Iron Maiden
fan, I present you with a list of their songs that refers heavily some pretty
popular literary installations.
