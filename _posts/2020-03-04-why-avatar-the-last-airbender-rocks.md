# Introduction

Just to make things absolutely clear, this post is not about the James
Cameron movie and neither is it about the Shyamalan adaptation. This is
exclusively about the Nickolodeon show that has secured a place in every
2000's kid's heart like a cat securing a place in its owner's lap.

# What is *Avatar: The Last Airbender*

I feel pity for you if you really need to read this section; you have
missed quite a special and extraordinary show ever to be aired. *Avatar:
The Last Airbender* has aired for three seasons through three years (2005
to 2008).

Even after a decade of its finale, it continues to be a shining example of
phenomenal storytelling. There are reasons why *Avatar* works so well, some
of which I'll try to point out for the uninitiated that the fans are going
to find obvious.

# The Worldbuilding

Since the birth of *Lord of the Rings*, the first thing any fantastical
story is criticized for is its worldbuilding. In simple terms, worlbuilding
is the task of creating a secondary world for a story to take place in that
adheres to its own set of rules.

The worldbuilding of *Avatar* is complex in its simpleness. The whole
exposition of the secondary world is given in the small window of the title
sequence of each episode. That should tell you how simple the world is.
And, because of that, the writers were able to stretch it above and beyond,
and play with it to satisfaction.

The intro in the title sequence is all you need to enjoy the show, but,
below, I discuss why the Worldbuilding is so ingenious and coherent.

The world of *Avatar* has four factions each of which follows the guideline
of its associated element. Air nomads live in secluded temples, detaching
themselves from material needs and focusing on the philosophical ones.
People of Water tribes live near the polar regions where water is aplenty,
showing incredible amount of adaptability, just like Water itself.
Inhabitants of Earth Kingdom live in grandiose cities, with immovable
principle and stoic ego. Citizens of Fire nation are warmongering and
destructive, like fire; but those who disavow their past teachings and
traditions become warm and lively, not unlike fire.

Some might see the resemblance of Asian culture and history with the world
of *Avatar*, and they would be correct to make that connection. The writers
did use the already complex culture in our world to solidify their
secondary one.  What's impressive is they made sure the nations don't
reflect any real world nation. Can you imagine what would have happened if
all the people of Fire nation were Chinese or Japanese? The writers were
better than that, unlike those of some other shows I can mention.

# Magic System

The second aspect that any fan looks into a fantastical show is its magic
system. Essentially, the rules everything in the secondary world adheres to
is its magic system.

The magic system in *Avatar* is based on bending, the ability to manipulate
an element. A dominant portion of every faction is able to bend its
associated element, with an exception that I really don't want to spoil for
anyone reading this who have not yet watched the show.

Some writers seem to think building a magic system is enough for a story to
work, without bothering to weave it into the story and character arcs.
*Avatar* works as well as it does because the magic system not only makes
the story fantastical, but actually builds the world block by block and
shapes the characters in interesting ways. Two examples follow.

Earth Kingdom of Ba-Sing-Se has a transport system system that relies on
Earthbending. Their trains don't have motors, because it has not been
invented yet. Instead, two Earthbenders push each train along its track.
Bam! Simple yet inventive. Magic system building the world before our eyes.

The other factions also have examples of their respective bending shaping
their lifestyle. Watch the show and you'll find out.

Beside building the world, magic system of *Avatar* also shapes the
characters. Katara, a Waterbender from the south pole, had to learn a new
kind of bending closely associated with Waterbending but doesn't actually
follow the ideology of Waterbending. In later episodes, it has shaped her
arc in clear and identifiable ways. For fear of spoilers, I'm going to stop
here.

Each of the characters has some aspect of their character shaped by the
magic system. That, ladies and gentlemen, is good writing.

# Incredible Characters

Although it's the third section in this post, the characters are actually
the most important aspect of any story. If we don't care about the
characters, even the most phenomenal secondary world with its ingenious
magic system won't be enough for us to enjoy.

All the characters in *Avatar* is incredibly versatile and self-consistent.
Each of them go through their own arc all the while shaping others'. Only
one example follows, among uncountable ones.

If one character has taken its place among fans' hearts more firmly than
others, it's Zuko. The banished prince of Fire nation first introduces
himself as the irresponsible and annoying youngster villain of the show,
only to surprise the viewers by having one of the best redemption arcs of
all time throughout the span of three seasons.

There are countless example of equally incredible character arcs: Toph's
journey from a fierce and belligerent master Earthbender into a more
sophisticated woman who doesn't have to prove her toughness to the world,
Sokka's journey from a sarcastic warrior with little ability as a warrior
into a responsible adult with extensive knowledge of battle and war. Even
the animal characters like Momo and Appa aren't excluded from amazing
character arcs. *Avatar* really is a precious story.

# Enjoy The Small Things

Almost everything in *Avatar* is incredible and ingenious. I have only
touched the surface of its awesomeness by showing some examples. Just to
display that I'm not just saying there's more, below is an example of
simple details that give the show some extra virtue.

Hair is pretty important in *Avatar*. The air nomads don't have hair while
citizens of Fire nation groom their hair to an exhaustible degree.

In the episodes following Aang's close encounter to death, where he
questions his ability to face the Fire Lord, Aang has to grow out his hair
in order to disguise himself. That simple act of growing hair has
tremendous effects on his psyche; he thinks it to be a betrayal of his
identity as an Air nomad.  He eventually gets out of depression and learns
that he *can* defeat the Fire Lord, which is shown by the scene where he
shaves his head and returns to his former self.

On the other hand is Azula, the daughter of Fire Lord Ozai. She is shown to
be a power-obsessed Firebending prodigy by her groomed and self-composed
demeanor which continues to unravel as she gradually grows unsure of her
worth, ultimately culminating into her complete breakdown in the scene
where she cuts off her hair.

# Not Everything is Sunshine and Rainbow

As much as I have praised the show, I won't shy away from revealing some of
its shortcomings, whatever little of it there is.

The biggest shortcoming was the length of each episode. It's a wonder the
writers did so much with such a low runtime of twenty-two minutes each
episodes. But the low length meant the characters didn't have to face
conflicts for long before they overcame it. Some storyline were given more
than one episode to flesh out the characters, giving them more and more
obstacles to overcome. So, the writers found a way even around the small
boundary of low runtime for each episode.

# Conclusion

There is so much more I have not talked about: the costume designs, the
martial arts, the fight scenes, the secondary characters, the spirit world.
I don't want to tell you everything, though. You'd have to watch the show
and judge it yourself.
